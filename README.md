# ML from scratch

## About
Building machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python, Scala and C++.

## Why this matters?
1. Developing the ability to translate math into code.
2. Taking your understanding of the algorithims to the next level.
3. Scikit-learn is no longer a black box now. I understand how it actually works.
